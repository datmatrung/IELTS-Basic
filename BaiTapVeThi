(1)	you	(fly) to America? Kevin is lucky - he (2)	(visit) his cousin Amy Baxter last
year. Yesterday, while Kevin (3)	(read) a book, his mother (4)	(come) in and gave him a
letter from Amy. He read: "Hi, Kevin, I hope you (5)	(not forget) me yet. I also hope you still
(6)	(remember) the great fun we (7)	(have) last year. What (8)	you	(do)
since then?"
Well, let me tell you the chaotic story of my trip to the Poconos. I (9)	(want) to spend a nice
weekend with my friend Jane. She (10)	(live) in Manhattan for some months now.
"I'm sure we (11)	(have) lots of fun," Jane said while I (12)	(unpack) my things. "If the
weather (13)	(be) fine tomorrow, we'll go on a trip to the Poconos." "I think this is a fantastic
idea," I (14)	(agree). "I can't wait to climb the highest mountains."
When we (15)	(drive) along Interstate 95 the next day, we (16)	(notice) a red light in
Jane's mother's car. "I think, if we (17)	(want) to reach the Poconos, we (18)	(need) to
look for help first", Jane's mother said.
"I (19)	never (read) the handbook, so I (20)	(not have) any idea what's wrong."
We (21)	(leave) the expressway and soon saw the sign of a car repair garage. The mechanic
quickly (22)	(check) the car and smiled. "Lady," he said, "l (23)	(see) this problem many
times before. I'm sorry, but a mechanic is not what you need. If you (24)	(not fill) up the tank,
you (25)	never (get) to the Poconos."
