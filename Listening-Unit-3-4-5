  I remember a teacher I had at primary school who was <wonderful>. From the first day, she
  was friendly and kind towards the students, who were eight years old. But she was also strict.
  I mean, on the first day, she took out this old-fashioned strap and banged it on the desk,
  and we all got <such> a fright, but she was trying to show us she was in control.
  She wasn't really that scary although she was quite short and she spoke in a loud voice.
  Everybody called her Mrs.T. She taught us every <subject>, so she taught us English, maths,
  writing, and actually, I can't remember what else!
  I guess what I used to enjoy most about her <class> was her personality, and the fact
  that she cared for all of her students, even the naughty ones. I remember her daughter lived
  in America, and she used to send over American sweets and chewing <gum> for Mrs.T
  to give to good students. All the students tried to be really good to get that reward!
