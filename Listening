I really like to <visit> this park which is not too far from my home. It's located <behind>
the Rosedale Hotel and just east of the Lido Hotel. It's called the Lido Park. You can <either>
enter the park through the west gate or the east gate.
The park is really <beautiful>. It's got quite a few different areas and it is very peaceful. 
There are pathways all around the park and a lot of grass and trees. There are two
ponds a small one where you can try to <fish> for goldfish in the summer time, and a very 
large pond where you can go skating in the <winter> time. Near the large pond is a picnic 
area where you can sit down and <relax>.
It's nice and shady because there are many tall trees nearby. There's also a play area for
small <children> with games and rides, a restaurant and a snack bar, and an <indoor> swimming pool.
