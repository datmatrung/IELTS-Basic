Assistant 1: Rawlings Insurance. Good morning. Can I help you?
Elisabeth: Oh, hello. I'm ringing to report an accident.
Assistant 1: A car accident?
Elisabeth: Yes.
Assistant 1: Just hold the line a moment please. I'm putting you through to our motor insurance department.
Assistant 2: Hello?
Elisabeth: Hello.
Assistant 2: I understand you want to report an accident?
Elisabeth: Yes. My car's been damaged - someone came out in front of me ...
Assistant 2: Could I just check a few personal details before we go any further?
Assistant: Oh yes, sorry.
Assistant 2: Your name, first of all.
Elisabeth: It's ELISABETH Ricard.
Assistant 2: Is that R-I-K-A-R-D?
Elisabeth: It's spelt with a C not a K.
Assistant 2: Oh, OK ... And your date of birth please?
Elisabeth: It's the eighth of October, 1975.
Assistant 2: ... And lastly, I just need to check your address.
Elisabeth: Oh, actually I moved house last month so the street name is different. 
It's 60 Forest Road. I think you've got 22 Ash Avenue on your records?
Assistant 2: I have. So, I'll just make a note of that ... That's fine ... 
And is that in the same town still? Callington?
Elisabeth: That's right.
Assistant 2: Right, now ... do you have your insurance policy in front of you?
Elisabeth: Yes, I do.
Assistant 2: Can you give me the policy number please? It's at the top.
Elisabeth: Oh yes. Five-oh-nine-two-four?
Assistant 2: It's in a box - it should start with letters ...
Elisabeth: Oh, C-Z- double eight-oh-nine?
Assistant 2: Thatâ€™s the one.

I'm going to tell	<you> about my best friend Lou An. We first met a few years ago at the
local athletics club. She's not really <good looking>, but she is very helpful and thoughtful,
and she has a really cheerful and outgoing personality. We have a lot in common, 
so I guess that's the main reason we became friends. Of course, we both love sport, 
especially running and cycling. She exercises for one or <two> hours every day. 
We also have similar tastes in <movies> and television programmes. She loves romantic comedies,
and so <do> I. She probably watches more sport than I do.
